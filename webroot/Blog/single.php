					It comes as no surprise that the steps taken by mankind ever since the second world war have been nothing less than monumental. With the innovation and then rampant use of technology, we have certainly accelerated our progress towards achieving an ideal quality of life. However, the labor this has enforced on the planet is finally breaking its knees. According to the World Economic Forum, the top five risks facing the planet right now are related to climate change. This passage aims to explore how businesses damage the fragile balance of our ecosystem and the actions needed to stifle the fire our greed has set.
					Firms, irrespective of their size, based in developed and developing countries employ a range of processes spanning the circuit of production, distribution and consumption that greatly harm the environment. From the exploitation of finite stores of fossil fuels, water resources and minerals to the toxic by-products, such as greenhouse gases and material waste, emitted as a result of all industrial production, the climate conundrum seems almost unsolvable now. According to www.climate.gov , Co2 emissions have reached an all time high at 407 parts per million(ppm) with China, the USA and India being the major perpetrators. This, coupled with poisonous levels of Sulphur dioxide and CFC, can cause biodiversity loss and ecosystem collapse amongst an array of other life-threatening results. Methods of transport including container shipping and airfare are also major proponents of a huge carbon footprint. Due to the nature of globalized economic networks, there is not a single region in the world protected from these events, irrespective of their stake in the damage. 
					Hence, due to grave situation at hand, events like the WEF summit 2020 will primarily focus on economic concerns. Transnational companies (TNCs) are being subjected to pressure from consumers, investors and employees  alike to reinforce their ‘social consciousness’ and  to curtail their impact on the environment. Companies must take measures to produce sustainable energy alongside healthier waste practices.
					Businesses that make the conscious switch towards renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar power, dramatically cut down their burning of climate crashing fuels like oil. Measures such as carbon capping, whereby a local governing body sets a ‘cap’ on total CO2 emission allowed in its jurisdiction can also dramatically reduce the carbon footprint. 
					Furthermore, more emphasis should be placed on implementing waste management using recycling techniques to alleviate some of the pressure from landfills and garbage dumps. Awareness about recycling should be raised from the ground level regarding dispensing knowledge about how it is actually done and how the collective efforts can prvoe extremely fruitful in these bleak times.
					Moreover, the transition to researching and developing environmentally friendlier, possibly electric, modes of transport can greatly reduce climate crashing fuel consumption. Hybrid vehicles can be employed for intra-region transport when distances between the source of production and the market are not huge.
					Lastly, techniques revolving extraction can be morphed into ones that are more hesitant in reshaping the local land. Companies leave in their wake ugly remnants of the process such as abandoned mines and boarded up warehouses which can be seen as the degradation of the landscape environment. This may also create animosity within local communities against involved companies and states.
					For any of the changes to be actually implemented above, geopolitical concerns have to be heeded which might stall actual change. This is why a step back from the globally networked economies may be necessary.
					For any of the measures needed to reverse the damage highlighted above, it is necessary for citizens, particularly those of developed countries, to be aware of all the facts. As highlighted by Brulle in ‘Institutionalizing Delay’, Climate Change Counter Movements play a major role in confounding general public opinion regarding concepts like global warming, reducing them to controversial phenomenons instead of actual fact. However, events like the Australian and Californian fires should play a role in amalgamating public opinion as one that pushes for change. Dicken explores how Civil Society Organizations, backed by said public opinion, exert the pressure needed on TNCs to bind to their Corporate Social Responsibility. Firms with an established code of conduct, like the Principles of the UN Global Compact, recognizes its social and environmental obligations and is likely to actually implement any of the solutions in A. 
					Applying the example of producing greener vehicles in part A, it can be established that the automobile sectors and involved states have already laid some groundwork. Car manufacturers in the EU and the USA have to follow strict protocols regarding engine efficiency and the carbon emission that can be produced by these vehicles. This runs simultaneously with the EU’s plan to implement ‘No-emission’ zones. Moreover, the EU has made it necessary for all automobile companies to ensure that 85percent of the vehicle’s weight constitutes recyclable parts. This is a step in the right direction and will hopefully be reciprocated by other nations as well.
					In reference to the recycling awareness proposal in A, Dicken describes how studies such as Bennet et al. have linked the level of recycling to an array of socioeconomic factors pertaining to individuals. While different countries may have different incentives/ penalties regarding recycling, Dickens highlights that changing beliefs about target groups through education, advertisement and information has had profound results. Individuals who have recycling habits are more likely to favor brands and companies that have embedded recycling into their processes, creating and solidifying a chain of greener practices.
					The companies and nations in the extractive sector can also learn a lesson or two regarding healthier practices. Shells’ behavior in Nigeria and the Ogonian protest towards Shells’ destructive environmental actions and the lack of financial restitution to offset these impacts. This Is an illustration for potential animosity against TNCs within local populaces that 
					Many nations, would albeit be reluctant in financing and enforcing the wide range of actions needed to save the environment. For instance, the controversial ban on the CSO Greenpeace by the India government testifies why global webs, with the environment being of different priorities in different countries, may lead to sticky situations. This is why a step back from the globalized networks might be necessary, as describe by Diona Harvey in her article in the Guardian, an ‘overhauling’ might be necessary,
