HTMl provides a set of ontainer tags. Those tags can contain an unspecified set of other tags.
We have: 
-article:
The article tag identifies a thing that can be independent from other thing in a page.
For example a list of blog posts in the homepage. Or a list of links.
<div>
  <article>
    <h2> A blog post</h2>
    <a...> Read more</a...> 
  </article>
  <article>
   <h2>Another blog post</h2>
   <a...> Read more</a...>
 </article>
</div>
We're not limited to lists: an article can be the main element in a page.
<article>
  <h2>A blog post</h2>
  <p>Here is the content...</p>
</article>

-section:
Represents a section of a documents. Each section has a heading tag(h1-h6), then the section body.
Eg:
<section>
  <h2>A section of the page</h2>
  <p>...</p>
  <img ... />
</section>
Its useful to break a long article into different sections.
Shouldnt be used as a generic container element. div is made for this.

-div:
div is the generic container element:
You often add a class or id attribute to this element, to allow it to be styled using CSS.
We use div in any place where we need a container but the existing tags are not suited.

TAGS RELATED TO PAGE:

nav
This tag is used to create the markup that defines the page navigation. Into this we typically add an ul or ol list:
nav
  <ol>
    <li><a href = "/">Home</a></li>
    <li><a href = "/blog">Blog</a></li>
  </ol>
</nav>

aside
The aside tag is used to add a piece of content that is related to the main content. A box where to add a quote, for example. Or a sidebar.
Example:
<div>
  <p>some text..</p>
  <aside>
    <p>A quote..</p>
  </aside>
  <p>other text...</p>
</div>Using aside is a signal that the things it contains are not part of the regular flow of the section it lives into.

Header
The header tag represents a part of the page that is the introduction. It can for example contain one or more heading tage(h1-h6), the tagline for the article, an image.
<article>
  <header>
    <h1>Article title</h1>
  </header>
  ...
</article>

main
The main tage represents the main part of a page:
<body>
  ...
  <main>
    <p>...</p>
  </main>
</body>

footer
The footer tag is used to determine the footer of an article or the foother of the page:
<article>
