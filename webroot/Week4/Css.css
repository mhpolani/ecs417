A CSS rule-set consists of a selector and a declaration block:

 h1(selector) {property:value; color:blue;} This shit inside the curly braces is called the declaration

The selector points to the HTML element you want to style.

The declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons.

Each declaration includes a CSS property name and a value, separated by a colon.

A CSS declaration always ends with a semicolon, and declaration blocks are surrounded by curly braces.

CSS selectors are used to "find" (or select) the HTML elements you want to style.

We can divide CSS selectors into five categories:

Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class)
Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)
Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state)
Pseudo-elements selectors (select and style a part of an element)
Attribute selectors (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value)
Selector	Example	Example description
.class	.intro	Selects all elements with class="intro"
#id	#firstname	Selects the element with id="firstname"
*	*	Selects all elements
element	p	Selects all <p> elements
element,element,..	div, p	Selects all <div> elements and all <p> elements

When there is more than one style specified for an HTML document, all the style sheets will cascade into a new "virtual" style sheet that has the following rules:
1- Inline style(inside an HTML element)
2- External and Internal Style sheets
3-Browser default

There are five different position values:
-static: An element with a static position is not positioned in any special way; it is always positioned according to the normal flow of the page.

-relative: An element with a relative position is positioned relative to its normal position.

-fixed: An element with a fixed position is positioned relative to the viewport, which means it always stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled.
A fixed element does not leave a gap in the page where it would normally have been located.
-absolute: This element is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor. If it has no positioned ancestors, it uses the document body(html page) and moves along with page scrolling
-sticky: This element is positioned based on the user's scroll position.

Overlapping elements:
When elements are positioned, they can overlap other elements.
The z-index property specifies the stack order of an element( which element should be placed in front of or behind the others.
An element can have a positive or a negative stack order.

-The overflow propert specifies whether to clip the content or to add scrollbars when the content of an element is too big to fit in the specified area.
-The overflow property has the following values:
visible - Default. The overflow is not clipped. The content renders outside the element's box
hidden - The overflow is clipped, and the rest of the content will be invisible
scroll - The overflow is clipped, and a scrollbar is added to see the rest of the content
auto - Similar to scroll, but it adds scrollbars only when necessary

Floating elements:
-Displace an element out of its position in the normal flow via the float property.
-Element can be floated to left or right.
-Item is moved all the way to the far left or far right of its container block.
-This leads to the rest of the content beig wrapped around the floated element.
